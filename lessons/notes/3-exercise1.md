# Python First Program Explanation:

```python
# This is a comment in Python. It is not executed by the program, but serves as a note for humans to understand the code.

print("First Program: Python print function")
# The `print()` function is used to display output in Python. In this line, it prints the string "First Program: Python print function".

print("It is declared like this:")
# This line prints the string "It is declared like this:".

print('print("what to print")')
# This line prints the string 'print("what to print")'. The use of single quotes (') and double quotes (") for strings is interchangeable in Python.

# The code execution will start from the top and proceed line by line.
