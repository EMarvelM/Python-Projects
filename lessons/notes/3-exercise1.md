## Python First Program Explanation:

1. This is a comment in Python.
```
#It is not executed by the program, but serves as a note for humans to understand the code.
```

2. The `print()` function is used to display output in Python. In this line, it prints the string "First Program: Python print function".
```
print("First Program: Python print function")
```

3. This line prints the string "It is declared like this:".
```
print("It is declared like this:")
```

4. This line prints the string 'print("what to print")'. The use of single quotes (') and double quotes (") for strings is interchangeable in Python.
```
print('print("what to print")')
```

#### NB: The code execution will start from the top and proceed line by line.

##Summary
This Python exercise is a simple introduction to using the print() function, which is used to display output in Python. It prints three different strings to the console, demonstrating how to use the print() function with single and double quotes.

Remember, comments (lines starting with #) are not executed by the program and are used to provide explanations or notes for human readers.
